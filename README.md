Advent of Code-2020 solutions

These are my Advent of Code 2020 solutions written in Java. These solutions are written fast to complete the problems in a short time and do not have much thought put in to them. Additionally, there are no comments.

The solutions take the input through console/scanner and most print the answer after you input nothing/an empty line to the console/scanner once or twice.
